Project Title: Cryptocurrency Price Prediction

Project Description:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict cryptocurrency prices using historical data. With the increasing popularity and volatility of cryptocurrencies, accurate price prediction can help investors and traders make informed decisions.

The project involves:

Data Collection: Collecting historical cryptocurrency price data (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) using APIs like YFinance or other data sources.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data by handling missing values, outliers, and scaling features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the historical trends, price movements, and correlations using libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
Feature Engineering: Identifying important features (e.g., trading volume, market sentiment, moving averages) to enhance model performance.
Model Building: Developing machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to predict cryptocurrency prices.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
Visualization: Presenting predictions and historical trends through interactive dashboards or static plots using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Objective:
To accurately predict future cryptocurrency prices based on historical data, assisting users in making strategic investment and trading decisions.

Technologies Used:

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras)
YFinance or other API tools for data collection
Jupyter Notebook/VS Code for development environment

Expected Outcome:
A functional prediction model capable of forecasting cryptocurrency prices with visual insights into trends and performance, ready for potential deployment as a decision-support tool.

Built With:

Python: The primary programming language for data processing, modeling, and visualization.
NumPy: For numerical computations and handling large datasets efficiently.
Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating insightful visualizations of data trends and patterns.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and more.
TensorFlow/Keras (optional): For implementing deep learning models like LSTMs to capture sequential patterns in cryptocurrency prices.
YFinance: For fetching historical cryptocurrency price data.
Jupyter Notebook/VS Code: As the development environment for writing and testing code.
This project is a practical implementation of machine learning techniques applied to real-world financial data, making it a valuable learning and predictive tool.
